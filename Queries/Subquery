Here is a subquery showing in which countries the top 5 customers reside: 

SELECT distinct(a.country),
       count(DISTINCT d.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
       count(DISTINCT a.country) AS top_customer_count
FROM country a
INNER JOIN city b ON a.country_id = b.country_id
INNER JOIN address c ON b.city_id = c.city_id
INNER JOIN customer d ON c.address_id = d.address_id
LEFT JOIN
  (SELECT a.customer_id,
          a.first_name,
          a.last_name,
          d.country,
          c.city,
          sum(e.amount) AS payment
   FROM customer a
   INNER JOIN address b ON a.address_id = b.address_id
   INNER JOIN city c ON b.city_id = c.city_id
   INNER JOIN country d ON c.country_id = d.country_id
   INNER JOIN payment e ON a.customer_id = e.customer_id
   GROUP BY a.customer_id,
            d.country,
            c.city
   ORDER BY payment DESC
   LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers ON a.country=top_5_CUSTOMERS.country
GROUP BY a.country,
         top_5_customers
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5
